# programing is list of instructions given to the computer to follow
# After you click save and run the following happens:
# 1. python interpreter looks at what is in the source code (set of instructions) and
# which means the python interpreter run all the source code in the source code window
# 2. prints out whatever relevant output
# A program written in a high-level programming language is called a source code
#  the file containing the source code is called the source file.
# a syntax: a set of rules (formal or informal, written or felt intuitively) used to determine if a certain string of
# words forms a valid sentence (e.g., "I am a python" is a syntactically correct phrase, while "I a python am" isn't)
# semantics: a set of rules determining if a certain phrase makes sense (e.g., "I ate a doughnut" makes sense, but
# "A doughnut ate me" doesn't)
# to translate high level language to machine language u need:
# 1. interpreter to translate one by one instruction in high level language  to machine language
# machine code is list of binary instructions (computer processor can read) which is executable program
# 2. compile to translate whole instructions in high level language program  to machine language
print("hello Ahmed")
print(7 // 3)    # This is the integer division operator
print(7 % 3)     # This is the remainder or modulus operator
print(18 / 4)
print(18.0 // 4)
